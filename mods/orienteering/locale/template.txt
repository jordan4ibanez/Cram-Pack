It shows you your yaw (horizontal viewing angle) in degrees.
It shows you your pitch (vertical viewing angle) in degrees.
It shows you your current elevation (Y).
It shows you the coordinates of your current position in the horizontal plane (X and Z).
The GPS device shows you your coordinates (X, Y and Z), your yaw (horizontal viewing angle) and the time.
It shows you your current horizontal (“hor.”) and vertical (“ver.”) speed in meters per second, where one meter is the side length of a single cube.
It shows you the current time.
This is the ultimate orientieering tool. It shows you your coordinates (X, Y and Z), shows your yaw and pitch (horizontal and vertical viewing angles), the current time, your current speed and it enables you to access the minimap.
The automapper automatically creates a map of the area around you and enables you to view a minimap of your surroundings. It also has a built-in radar.

Put this tool in your hotbar to see the data it provides.
Put the watch in your hotbar to see the time. Leftclick to toggle between the 24-hour and 12-hour display.
Put this tool in your hotbar to make use of its functionality. Leftclick to toggle between 24-hour and 12-hour display for the time feature.
If you put an automapper in your hotbar, you will be able to access the minimap. By default the minimap can be opened with [F7].
